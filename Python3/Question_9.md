# Container With Most Water
```python3
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height)-1
        max_water = 0
        while left < right:
            width = right - left
            max_water = max(max_water, width * min(height[left], height[right]))
            if height[left] > height[right]:
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1
        return max_water
```
